```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet looks simple, but it hides a subtle error that can be tricky to spot. The `sort` function from `Data.List` operates in a lazy manner.  While it produces the correct sorted list, it doesn't fully evaluate the list until it's forced to. This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with infinite lists or lists with expensive computations within their elements.
